## Project Overview

- [Lambda School - Computer Science "Build Week" Repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Build-Week-1)



The Game of Life's key features include:

- Grid that displays cells
- Cell objects that have state: dead of alive
- Clickable cells with a function to toggle dead or alive state
- Game to run off of manually selected cell states
- Generation counter that keeps tracks and displays game rounds
- Buttons that start, stop, clear, randomly select cell state, and control speed and grid size
- Algorithm that applies the game rules. See [Wikipedia for Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Tech Stack

### Front-end built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Currently anindustry standard for web applications, using React let me manage state change between two canvases used to track changes and display the proper game data. Additionally I was able to display other content for the app through components.

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS compiler helped us iterate more quickly on styling with the efficient use of nesting. This assisted the ability to display the modal pop up which has an animated effect. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
