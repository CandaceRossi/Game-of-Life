      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                <p class="popup__text">The Game of Life is a cellular-automaton, zero player game, developed by John Conway in 1970. The game is played on an infinite grid of square cells, and its evolution is only determined by its initial state.</p>
                <p>The rules of the game are simple, and describe the evolution of the grid: ◮ Birth: a cell that is dead at time t will be alive at time t + 1 if exactly 3 of its eight neighbors were alive at time t. ◮ Death: a cell can die by: ◮ Overcrowding:
                    if a cell is alive at time t + 1 and 4 or more of its neighbors are also alive at time t, the cell will be dead at time t + 1. ◮ Exposure: If a live cell at time t has only 1 live neighbor or no live neighbors, it will be dead at time
                    t + 1. ◮ Survival: a cell survives from time t to time t + 1 if and only if 2 or 3 of its neighbors are alive at time t.</p>

                <p>Starting from the initial configuration, these rules are applied, and the game board evolves, playing the game by itself! This might seem like a rather boring game at first, but there are many remarkable facts about this game. Today we
                    will see the types of “life-forms” we can create with this game, whether we can tell if a game of Life will go on infinitely, and see how a game of Life can be used to solve any computational problem a computer can solve.</p>
