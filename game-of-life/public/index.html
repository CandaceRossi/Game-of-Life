      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                <p class="popup__text"> The Game of Life is a cellular-automaton, zero player game, developed by John Conway in 1970. </p><br />
                <p> Based on the state of each cell, whether each cell is alive or dead through a given round of the game, the community of cells evolve.</p><br />
                <h4> The rules are as follow: </h4>
                <p>◮ Birth: a dead cell will come alive if exactly 3 of its neighbors were alive.</p> <br/>
                <p>◮ Death: a cell can die by: </p>
                <p>◮ Overcrowding: if an alive cell has 3 or more alive neighbors, the cell will die. </p>
                <p>◮ Exposure: If an alive cell has only 1 or 0 live neighbors, it will die</p> <br/>
                <p>◮ Survival: a cell survives round to round if and only if 2 or 3 of its neighbors are alive.</p> <br/>
                <p> Pay attention and see repetitive types of “life-forms” created in the game and whether a game of life session will go on infinitely.</p>
